# simple-banking used with QBCore Framework
# All credits for this go to https://github.com/Pawsative 

###### This is by no means a leak, I talked to the original developer of simple banking and we talked about me releasing this for everyone since he is re-coding the banking and he give me his permission to release it. So huge thanks to him.

###### This banking is NP 3.0 styled banking with business and gang accounts 

### Some parts of the code might be dodo because .lua files were done really quickly (it will get updated) for .js everyone is welcome to make a PR to improve it because I'm not really good with js so yea f me bruh lol

###### You do not need QB-moneysafe with this banking it has society coded in and only players with specific job/gang and grade can see the business and gang account
